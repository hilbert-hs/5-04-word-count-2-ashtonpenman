# 5.04-Word-Count-Take2

In this lab we will use oure word-counting code from Lab 6.02 to create a program that determines the top 5 most commonly used words in a (hard-coded) passage of text. After processing the passage, it prints the top 5 words and the number of times each occurs.

## Algorithm

1. Repackage some of your code from Lab 6.02 to make two functions:
  a. `text_to_word_list()`, that takes a single passage of text and splits into a list of words;
  b. `count_frequencies()`, that takes in a list of  words and returns a dictionary of word frequencies.

You could also do this by importing your 6.02 code as a separate `.py` file and using `import` to bring it into your new code.

2. Write a new function, `find_max_valued_key()`, that takes a dictionary as an argument, and returns the key that is associated with the largest
value in that dictionary. Internally, this function loops through the dictionary while keeping track of the largest value it's seen so far and
the key that goes along with that value.
3. Run `find_max_valued_key()` once on the dictionary of word counts, print out the key/value of word it returns.
4. Remove that key from the dictionary.
5. Repeat steps 3-4 four more times: Call `find_max_valued_key()`, print out the key/value pair, and remove the key.

If there is a tie within find_max_valued_key(), choose among the tied items however you like and return just one of them.

## Example Output

Here's an example of the program output with the hard-coded text passage set to the opening lines of Dr. Seuss's poem Green Eggs and Ham:
```
I am Sam. I am Sam. Sam I am.
That Sam-I-am! That Sam-I-am!
I do not like that Sam-I-am!
Do would you like green eggs and ham?
I do not like them, Sam-I-am.
I do not like green eggs and ham.
Would you like them here or there?
I would not like them here or there.
I would not like them anywhere.
I do not like green eggs and ham.
I do not like them, Sam-I-am.
Would you like them in a house?
Would you like then with a mouse?
I do not like them in a house.
I do not like them with a mouse.
I do not like them here or there.
I do not like them anywhere.
I do not like green eggs and ham.
I do not like them, Sam-I-am.
```

```
i appears 22 times
like appears 17 times
not appears 13 times
do appears 12 times
them appears 11 times
```

## Bonus
1. The process of finding the largest element, printing it, and removing it from the dictionary is a way to sort items. Write a function that will return a sorted list of all the words from most frequent to least frequent.
2. Change the code to find the least frequent words.
3. Refactor your code so it pulls text from a separate `.txt` file instead of a hard-coded string.
